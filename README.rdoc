INTRODUCTION

This project is our first technical test for you, our future KFit engineer. Your job is to write a Ruby script to scrape KFit partners in Kuala Lumpur and store the result in CSV file.

INSTRUCTION

Store these details in the CSV file: city, partner name, address, latitude, longitude, average rating

Save the script as get_kfit.rb and output the result to kfit_partners.csv. We should be able to run it with this command ruby get_kfit.rb.

Make as many commits as needed.

When you are ready, make a pull request in Github.

BONUS POINT

Yes, we have a hidden level! For the bonus point, include partner's phone number in the CSV file.

EXAMPLE PARTNER

For this partner (https://access.kfit.com/partners/517?city=kuala-lumpur), we would expect the CSV file to be:

city, partner name, address, latitude, longitude, average rating
Kuala Lumpur, HOT YO STUDIO, "26-2 (Second Floor), Jalan 24/70A, Desa Sri Hartamas, 50480 W.P. Kuala Lumpur (opposite Burger King Hartamas)", 3.162909, 101.650887, 4.5
CSV with bonus point:

city, partner name, address, latitude, longitude, average rating, phone number
Kuala Lumpur, HOT YO STUDIO, "26-2 (Second Floor), Jalan 24/70A, Desa Sri Hartamas, 50480 W.P. Kuala Lumpur (opposite Burger King Hartamas)", 3.162909, 101.650887, 4.5, "+60362113263"
It doesn't have to be 100% similar CSV format, what important is you are able to write down partner's details.
